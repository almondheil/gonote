Simple note tagging and searching tool.

Stores tags as in-file YAML frontmatter, so it's all human-readable and easily editable. Probably won't work well for large collections of notes, since storing notes per-file means a lot of reading for search-based operations.

# Install

```
go install github.com/almondheil/gonote@latest
```

I am happy because this is **so much** easier than installing py-note on a fresh machine
